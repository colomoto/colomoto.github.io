summary: Rules for the selection of the successor state(s)
---

The dynamical analysis of a logical model relies on the logical functions,
as well as an **updating policy**, defining the behaviour of conccurent updates.
**Deterministic** policies always yield a single successor state,
while **non-deterministic** ones can generate multiple alternative successors.
