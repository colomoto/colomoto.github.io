title: "bioLQM: Logical Qualitative Modelling toolkit"
summary: Java library for the manipulation and conversion of logical models
---


bioLQM is a Java toolkit for the conversion, transformation, and analysis of
Logical Qualitative Models of biological regulatory networks.


The bioLQM toolkit supports the SBML-qual exchange format, as well as specialised formats
used by existing tools, facilitating the design of workflows combining these tools.

Model transformations enable the definition of perturbations, model reduction, as well as model
Booleanization for the study of multivalued models with tools limited to the Boolean case.

Finally, bioLQM provides reference implementation of common analysis tools, in particular 
the common updating modes for model simulation, as well as some static analysis tools
for the identification of attractors.

This toolkit can be integrated into analysis workflows through command line and scripting interfaces.
It also provides core data structures underlying the [GINsim](http://ginsim.org) and 
[EpiLog](http://epilog-tool.org) interactive tools.
