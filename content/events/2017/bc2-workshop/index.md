## Background

Logical models have long been used to explore the dynamical behaviours of regulatory networks. Over the past years, the types of available data that nourish the models or that the models need to explain has led to the development and the evolvement of modelling methods and tools in order to answer more specific problems. Indeed, logical modelling has become more and more reliant on transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenetic data.

The scope of this workshop is to provide an overview of the recent developments on methods and applications on the use of the logical formalism for the modelling of regulatory networks.

Following a community effort with the [Consortium for Logical Models and Tools](http://colomoto.org)) to promote the exchange of models and to improve existing methods, we propose a workshop that will also expose the advances in the understanding of signalling pathways, cell differentiation, cell reprogramming or cell metabolism, etc.

We will cover the following three main topics:

* modelling tools: GINsim, CellNOpt, optimusqual, MaBoSS, CellCollective, EpiLog, etc;
* current state of the art methods for static and dynamical analysis;
* biological applications using logical modelling.

 

## Organization

The workshop will be divided into two sessions: one session dedicated to recent developments of methods and tools; and another session dedicated to modelling applications to cell biology. Each session will be composed by one keynote presentation, followed by 5 presentations. At the end of the each session, we will devote some time for discussions with the audience.



## Target audience

This workshop should appeal to all students and researchers interested in learning about the recent developments on modelling regulatory networks, ranging from recent biological applications, to the development of methods and tools.
