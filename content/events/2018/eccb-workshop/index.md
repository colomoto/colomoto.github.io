title: Workshop at ECCB 2018
date: 2018-09-25
summary: One-day workshop on sept 08 (Athens, Greece)
---

Anna Niarakis and Denis Thieffry organized a one-day workshop dedicated to Logical Modelling in the context of the
[European Conference on Computational Biology](http://eccb18.org).
This workshop took place in Athens on September 08, before the main ECCB conference (September 09-12).
More details are available on the [workshop page](http://eccb18.org/workshop-6).


## Summary

Logical models have long been used to explore the dynamical behaviours of regulatory networks.
This workshop provides an overview of recent methodological developments and applications on the
use of the logical formalism for the modelling of regulatory networks, covering the following main topics:

* Computational methods: attractor identification, model-checking, reduction techniques, network inference
* Modelling tools: GINsim, CellNetOpt, boolSim, MaBoSS, CellCollective, EpiLog, ...
* Biological applications: signalling networks, cell differentiation, cell reprogramming

The workshop was split in two sessions: the first session is dedicated to recent methodological developments,
the second session to biological case studies. Each of these sessions includes one introductory talk.
It is further articulated with a tutorial organized by Tomas Helikar and Juilee Thakar on Sept 9th, 2018,
thereby forming a two-days long SIG meeting devoted to logical modelling of cellular networks.
