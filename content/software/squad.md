BoolSim implements an efficient algorithm, based on binary decision diagrams, to identify all attractors
(stable states, as well as cyclic attractors) of Boolean models.
SQUAD derives continuous dynamical models from logical models, and performs continuous simulations,
allowing the modification of several parameters.
