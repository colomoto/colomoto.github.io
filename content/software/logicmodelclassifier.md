LogicModelClassifier consists of various Python
scripts (not documented) that allow the explicit enumeration and storage
of models that are incompletely specified, in a SQL database. Various
scripts for the creation of a model pool (CSP enumeration, sampling and
perturbations), model annotation (NuSMV model checking) and analysis
(basic "logical data analysis") exist.
