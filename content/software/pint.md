Pint implements static analyses for computing dynamical properties on very large-scale Automata Networks (inc. Boolean and multi-valued networks),
ranging from hundreds to several thousands of concurrently interacting components.
Provided analyses include notably the listing of fixed points, successive reachability properties, cut sets
and mutations for reachability, and model reduction preserving transient dynamics.

Pint is distributed with command line tools, as well as a Python module pypint.
This later provides a seamless integration with the Jupyter IPython notebook web interface.
