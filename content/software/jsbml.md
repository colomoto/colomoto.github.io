JSBML is a comprehensive implementation of datastructures and parsers
for the SBML standard in Java ™. JSBMLhas been designed as an
application programing interface (API) library that can be used as a
back-end in SBML supporting software. It strives to attain a high
compatibility to the library C/C++ library libSBML, which also provides
a Java API through automatically generated native language wrappers. In
contrast, JSBML It is completely platform independent and has been
designed from scratch, specifically for the Java™ programming language.
Advanced features of JSBML comprise specific change listeners that
facilitate keeping track of modifications to the data structure, and
modules for end-user applications (for instance, a CellDesigner plug-in
module, a compatibility module for libSBML etc.). JSBML implements all
currently defined extension packages for SBML, including "qual". Its
sophisticated type hierarchy and flexible data structure can be used as
internal data representation of end-user software.
