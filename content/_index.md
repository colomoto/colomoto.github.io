CoLoMoTo (Consortium for Logical Models and Tools) is a consortium of [research groups](members)
interested in logical (qualitative) modelling of biological systems: modelers, curators and
developers of methods and software tools.
The consortium works on the definition of standards for model representation and
interchange (especially the [SBML qual format](formats/sbml-qual)), and on 
the comparison of methods, models and tools.


This website reports on the [activities of the consortium](meetings),
and provides an overview of available [software tools](software)
and [biological models](models) based on the logical formalism.
