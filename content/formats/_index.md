We encourage the use of the [SBML qual exchange format](sbml-qual) to share models to a wide audience.
However, many alternative formats exist for historical or technical reasons.

* Models defined in SBML qual can be converted to all formats listed here.
* Models defined in one of these formats can often (but not always) be converted to SBML qual.
* Most formats are limited to logical rules, some also support annotations and graphical style.
