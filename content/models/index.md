Logical models are available from  various repositories:

* [BioModels](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels) is a database of models in the
  SBML formats. Some logical models are available using the SBML qual extension.
* [The Cell Collective](http://www.thecellcollective.org) provides models
  in several formats, including SBML qual.
* The [GINsim's model repository](http://ginsim.org/models_repository)
  provide models in the GINML format, which can be converted to SBML qual
  (and other formats) using GINsim.
* The [PyBoolNet repository](https://github.com/hklarner/PyBoolNet/tree/master/PyBoolNet/Repository)
  contains a small collection of Boolean networks.
