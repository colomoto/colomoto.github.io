This project addresses fundamental research issues in computer science on the interplay between structure and dynamics in
large interaction networks, and on mixed analog-discrete computation. We contribute to the theory of biochemical computation,
and develop since 2002 a modelling, analysis and synthesis software, the Biochemical Abstract Machine, BIOCHAM.
The reaction rule-based language of this system allows us to reason about biochemical reaction networks at different levels of
abstraction, in the stochastic, differential, discrete, Boolean and hybrid semantics of reaction systems.
We develop a variety of static analysis methods before going to simulations and dynamical analyses. We use quantitative temporal
logics as a mean to formalise biological behaviours with imprecise data and to constrain model building or network synthesis.
