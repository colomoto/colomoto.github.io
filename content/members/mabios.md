Interdisciplinary group from the Institut de Math√©matique de Marseille (I2M), with a central interest on 
biological networks, in particular dynamical regulatory networks and large-scale interaction networks.
The group is composed of CNRS researchers and assistant professors from different backgrounds:
(bio)mathematicians, computer scientists and bioinformaticians.
Their joined expertises cover the development of computational methods and tools for the analyses of protein
interaction networks, discrete mathematics and computational science for the modelling of regulatory networks. 

In particular, their experience in collaborative interdisciplinary projects through the modeling and analysis of
genetic networks is attested by several publications. One of their main interests in this domain is to understand
the links between the structure of the interaction graphs, and typical dynamical properties of the dynamics.
Their constant objective is to stay close to the biological applications, and their theoretical results are used
to improve the analysis of biological networks.
