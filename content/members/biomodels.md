The BioModels Database is a repository of peer-reviewed, published, computational models,
primarily from the field of systems biology and of general biological interest.
BioModels allows biologists to store, search and retrieve published mathematical models.
In addition, models in the database can be used to generate sub-models, can be simulated online,
and can be converted between different representational formats.
This resource also features programmatic access via Web Services.
