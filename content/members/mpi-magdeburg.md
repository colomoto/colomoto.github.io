Research of the group lies in the field of Systems Biology, at the intersection of biology, mathematics and engineering sciences.
We develop theoretical methods for the analysis, inference, and targeted modification of bio-molecular networks and employ
these methods in collaboration with biological partners, for example, to identify cellular signaling networks from experimental data
or to rationally (re)design the metabolism of bacteria for the production of certain chemicals.
A long-term goal is the routine use of mathematical modeling in biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine.
