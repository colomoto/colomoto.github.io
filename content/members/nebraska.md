Our research focus is three-fold:

1) Better understand the dynamics of molecular and cellular mechanisms in complex networks under healthy as well as diseased conditions

2) Development of technologies to enable more efficient utility of computational systems biology through scientific crowd-sourcing, and

3) Implementation of interactive technologies and computational modeling as a means to improve life sciences education.
