The aim of the IBIS group is to unravel bacterial regulatory networks through a systems biology approach, making use of both models and experiments. In particular, we focus on the enterobacterium Escherichia coli, for which enormous amounts of genomic, genetic, biochemical and physiological data have been accumulated over the past decades. A better understanding of the regulatory networks of E. coli is a necessary prerequisite for interfering with its functioning, by specific external perturbations or by the rewiring the underlying regulatory networks. This does not only spawn fundamental research on the control of living matter, but also has technological relevance, since E. coli is a widely accepted host organism for biotechnological applications.
