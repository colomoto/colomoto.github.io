Within both groups we are interested in computational modeling and analysis in molecular systems biology
and the mathematical questions motivated by the applications. Special emphasis is placed on constraint-based
methods as well as discrete or hybrid discrete-continuous modeling approaches. Topics of cooperation with
researchers from the life sciences range from oncogenic signaling in humans over mammalian reproduction
systems to the metabolism of microorganisms.

We accompany our theoretical work with software development to support its application.
