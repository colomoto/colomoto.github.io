The [SW Algorithms and Tools for Constraint Solving (SAT) group](http://sat.inesc-id.pt) is part of INESC-ID (Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores: I&D), a research institution associated with the [Instituto Superior Tecnico](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt).

The long term objectives of the research group are: integer linear programming algorithms; discrete optimization algorithms and their applications; propositional satisfiability algorithms; applications of discrete optimization in electronic design automation; and formal verification of digital systems and digital system testing.
With applications to the verification of software, hardware and biological systems.
