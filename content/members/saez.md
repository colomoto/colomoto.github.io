The goal of our group is to acquire a functional understanding of the deregulation of signalling networks in disease and to apply this knowledge to novel therapeutics. This deregulation in how cell process and react to extracellular information is a hallmark of multiple pathological conditions. Our main application is cancer, but we also work on metabolic and auto-immune diseases.
Logic modelling based on phosphoproteomic data is a major tool in our group towards this end.
