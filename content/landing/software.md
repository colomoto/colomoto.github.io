Many software tools have been developed to support the analysis of qualitative models.
These tools have often been used separately, however as they provide complementary features,
we think they can be combined to build rich analysis workflows.

The CoLoMoTo consortium has worked on the [SBML qual](formats/sbml) to enable interoperability
between some of these tools. See the [list of  software tools](software).

### The CoLoMoTo Docker distribution and Notebook

The [CoLoMoTo Docker distribution](colomoto-docker/) further provides a single Docker image integrating a large
collection of tools and facilitates reproducible analysis and edition of Jupyter notebooks.
Check the [list of integrated tools](https://colomoto.github.io/colomoto-docker/tools/index.html) and the related tutorials and case studies on 
the [website](https://colomoto.github.io/colomoto-docker/README.html).
