Many software tools have been developed to support the analysis of qualitative models.
These tools have often been used separately, however as they provide complementary features,
we think they can be combined to build rich analysis workflows.

The CoLoMoTo consortium has worked on the [SBML qual](formats/sbml) to enable interoperability
between some of these tools.
The [CoLoMoTo Notebook](notebook) further provides a single Docker image integrating a large
collection of tools and facilitates reproducible analysis.
