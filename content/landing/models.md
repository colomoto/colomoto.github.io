Logical models are available from  various repositories listed below.
We encourage the use of the [SBML qual exchange format](sbml-qual) to share models to a wide audience.
However, other formats exist for historical or technical reasons.

* [BioModels](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels) is a database of models in the SBML format, including some qualitative models.
* [Cell Collective](http://cellcollective.org) provides models in several formats, including SBML qual.
* The [GINsim's model repository](http://ginsim.org/models_repository) provide models in the GINML format.
* The [PyBoolNet repository](https://github.com/hklarner/pyboolnet/tree/master/pyboolnet/repository) contains a small collection of models.

See the [list of common formats](formats).
