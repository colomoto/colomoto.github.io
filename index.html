interested in logical (qualitative) modelling of biological systems: modelers, curators and
developers of methods and software tools.
The consortium works on the definition of standards for model representation and
interchange (especially the <a href=formats/sbml-qual>SBML qual format</a>), and on
the comparison of methods, models and tools.</p><p>The CoLoMoTo consortium was announced in the following publication:<div class=ref><div class="type article" title="Type: article (Open Access)"><img class=oa src=https://colomoto.github.io/icons/openaccess_white.svg></div><a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv013><span class=title>Cooperative development of logical modelling standards and tools with CoLoMoTo.</span></a>

We encourage the use of the <a href=sbml-qual>SBML qual exchange format</a> to share models to a wide audience.
However, other formats exist for historical or technical reasons.</p><ul><li><a href=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels>BioModels</a> is a database of models in the SBML format, including some qualitative models.</li><li><a href=http://cellcollective.org>Cell Collective</a> provides models in several formats, including SBML qual.</li><li>The <a href=http://ginsim.org/models_repository>GINsim&rsquo;s model repository</a> provide models in the GINML format.</li><li>The <a href=https://github.com/hklarner/pyboolnet/tree/master/pyboolnet/repository>PyBoolNet repository</a> contains a small collection of models.</li></ul><p>See the <a href=formats>list of common formats</a>.</p></div></section><section class=hg3><div class=content><h1>Software tools</h1><p>Many software tools have been developed to support the analysis of qualitative models.
These tools have often been used separately, however as they provide complementary features,
we think they can be combined to build rich analysis workflows.</p><p>The CoLoMoTo consortium has worked on the <a href=formats/sbml>SBML qual</a> to enable interoperability
between some of these tools.
The <a href=notebook>CoLoMoTo Notebook</a> further provides a single Docker image integrating a large
collection of tools and facilitates reproducible analysis.</p><p>See the <a href=software>list of available software tools</a>.</p></div></section><section class=hg2><div class=content><h1>Methods</h1><div class=feat><h1 id=updating-semantics>Updating semantics</h1><p>Qualitative models provide logical rules controlling the activity level of each component. The updating
semantics further defines the application of these rules, especially when the level of multiple components
can be updated in the current state.</p><p>Deterministic semantics (e.g. <a href=updatings/synchronous>synchronous</a>) define a single successor. They are
convenient for simulations but could generate artefactual behaviours due to their strong kinetic assumptions.</p><p>Non-deterministic semantics (e.g. <a href=updatings/asynchronous>asynchronous</a> or <a href=updatings/permissive>permissive</a>)
provide a collection of alternative trajectories to capture the incertainty often associated to qualitative models.
They are more likely to generate realistic biological behaviours, but it can be burried among a large number of
trajectories (some artefactual) and they are more difficult to simulate.</p><p>See the <a href=updatings>list of updating semantics</a>.</p></div><div class=feat><h1 id=simulations>Simulations</h1><p>Simulations provide a natural way to evaluate the dynamical behaviour of a qualitative model by defining an
initial state and applying the update functions.</p><p><strong>Deterministic</strong>: <a href=simulation/trace>Traces</a> or <a href=simulation/continuous>continuous view</a>.</p><p><strong>Non-deterministic</strong>: <a href=simulation/stg>State Transition graph</a> or <a href=simulation/stochastic>stochastic sampling</a>.</p></div><div class=feat><h1 id=static-analysis>Static analysis</h1><p>Static analysis methods provide some dynamical informations without performing explicit simulations,
which is especially useful for large models where classical simulations become untractable.
These methods are well suited for the identification (or at least approximation) of attractors
(representing stable phenotypes) and some reachability properties.</p><p>See the <a href=static>list of static analysis methods</a>.</p></div></div></section><section class=hg1><div class=content><h1>Contact and members</h1><p>The <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/colomoto-discuss/>CoLoMoTo mailing list</a> is our main communication channel,
